Precalculate the Domain and Range of Your Training Set
======================================================

Thereâ€™s one more piece of preparation to do before actually training the
neural networks. For efficiency, quantities like the bounds on the physical
input and output parameters are gathered from the training set just once, then
saved in ``nn_config.toml``. You can gather this information with the
following command::

  $ neurosynchro lock-domain-range xformdir nndir

Here ``xformdir`` is the path to *transformed* training set (use ``.`` if you
wrote the transformed data to a file in the current directory) and ``nndir``
is the path to the directory containing your ``nn_config.toml`` file. This
command will rewrite this file, embedding the needed quantities.
